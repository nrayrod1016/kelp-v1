# Kelp by kelp 
# #Kelp is an app where a user will be able to add restaurants (mainly vegetarian and pescetarian) and share them with other users. Users will be able to interact with each other through these restaurant posts. My inspiration came from my love/ background of food... and the industry I guess.
